  <h1> Computer science and its crucial role in fighting Covid-19 - Muffy Calder  </h1>
 <p>
 It’s sometimes hard to remember there was once a world where computers were not ubiquitous – where no pockets carried a smartphone, where no workplace had an intranet, where a message sent to the other side of the world could take months to arrive, and where working through the consequences of complex equations meant a lot of pencil and paper.

 <tr><td> Lennon Rodgers, director of the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Grainger Engineering Design Innovation Laboratory, created a prototype “contactless” thermometer by borrowing the sensor from a commercially available thermometer and adding a microcontroller and distance sensor controlled by open-source code.
</td><td> While the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted academia as a whole, the crunch of balancing research, teaching and family responsibilities has fallen particularly hard on women faculty members. With that in mind, Biomedical Engineering Associate Professor Pamela Kreeger and frequent collaborator Kristyn Masters, a Vilas Distinguished Professor of biomedical engineering and H.I. Romnes Faculty Fellow at UW-Madison, have put together a list of 10 suggestions for women principal investigators to better navigate the juggling act of research, teaching, mentorship, service and at-home commitments during the pandemic. Their article, published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology and coauthored with seven other women faculty members from across the country, drew more than 5,000 views within 24 hours of publishing online, along with a steady stream of tweets..</td><td>As the COVID-19 pandemic first took hold in regions across the United States in spring 2020, governors, mayors and local leaders hoping to quell the spread of the virus turned to the only actionable defenses available at the time: They closed schools and businesses, banned mass gatherings, issued stay-at-home orders and enforced other social distancing measures. Now, a study published Oct. 27, 2020, in the Annals of Internal Medicine by University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers quantifies the region-specific impact of social distancing measures on the COVID-19 caseload in three distinct areas: New York City, the Milwaukee metropolitan area and Dane County in Wisconsin.</td></tr>
